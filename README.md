## Notes for the assessor

Current working branch is the [Alpha Build v0.2](https://github.com/crh82/BellmanProject/tree/AlphaBuildv02).

### Instructions for running the software
The software was developed using the Unity Game Engine and runs as a standalone application. It does not need to be built.
1. Navigate to the [OneDrive directory](https://anu365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/u6810978_anu_edu_au/EtVr8-Dew_hDkou9th8lGskBYH0H0HppADKREnGeMQGZeg?e=SmK61w)
2. Download the directory corresponding to your chosen operating system.
   - **MacOS**
     - Download `BellmanProjectMacOS`
   - **Linux**
     - Download `BellmanProjectLinux`
   - **Windows:**
     - Download `BellmanProjectWindows`
3. Run the executable 
   - Linux
Navigate to **link to come**!

#### Linux
Navigate to **link to come**!

## Note for MacOS
Once the BellmanProjectMacOS.tar.gz is decompressed, you will need to open the application using the right click open option to permit the software to runâ€”this is due to Apple's quarantining of non-AppStore software.

If downloading the BellmanProjectMacOS.tar.gz has not worked. Either contact me at u6810978@anu.edu.au or you can download the directory from *LINK TO COME*. However, because of Apple's stringent quarantining of any software not downloaded from its AppStore, when the file is unzipped and you attempt to run the software you may get an unspecificed error. This is the quarantining. This is an ongoing issue that the [Unity development team are still trying to address](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/macos-builds-now-contain-a-quarantine-attribute?page=1#comments). They suggest running the commmand `xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine path/to/game.app` from the terminal, however this did not work for me when I was testing it. To bypass the issue, in the terminal, I needed to run the command `chmod -R 777 <Path to BellmanProjectMacOS Directory>/BellmanProject_MacOS.app`

## Instructions for navigating the software's main solver
